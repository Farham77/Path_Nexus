# Path_Nexus

**Path_Nexus** is an interactive **Pathfinding Visualizer** built as a Discrete Mathematics project.  
It allows users to visualize how various pathfinding algorithms work on a grid, with **attractive animations** to make understanding easier.

## Features

- Visualizes the following algorithms:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
  - **A* Algorithm**
- Users can:
  - Create their own **start and end points**
  - Add **walls and obstacles**
  - Observe algorithm steps in **real-time with animations**
- Provides an educational tool to understand the **functioning of algorithms** in a fun and interactive way.
